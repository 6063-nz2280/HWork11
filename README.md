 The lock I have designed involves a three-step process for opening. Firstly, one must turn the potentiometers. Following this, the second step entails continuously pressing the button, and the final step involves holding down the photoresistors.

Originally, the photoresistors were intended to activate the flash by detecting light. However, in practice, I observed that indoor lighting conditions were sufficiently bright, prompting me to modify the design. Consequently, I opted to use the photoresistors to detect the absence of light instead, effectively incorporating it as a component of the password mechanism.

I encountered significant difficulties while setting up the second password. Initially, when I pressed it, other light bulbs started flashing. In an attempt to resolve this issue, I experimented by changing the button, replacing the light bulb, and adjusting its placement by increasing the distance. Fortunately, these modifications proved successful, and the problem was resolved.
